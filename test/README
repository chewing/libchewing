The directory contains test suite for libchewing.

Here are the instructions:

1. Build
  # make

2. Test default test case.
  # make check

3. Simulate batch testing
  # ./simulate

4. (Optional) Use your own test cases.
  # ./genkeystroke test.txt
  # make check 

5. (Optional) Stress test for libchewing robustness.
  # ./randkeystroke | ./testchewing

Note:

1. The hash data is generated in current path, and feel free
   to replace with any existing hash.dat like:
  # cp -f ~/.chewing/uhash.dat .

2. The way to debug genkeystroke via gdb is a bit tricky since it uses ncurses
   library.  First, launch two X terminals such as rxvt.  Assume X Terminal (1)
   is the window where the expected ncurses application shows, and X Terminal
   (2) the one where gdb runs.

    X Terminal (1)                  X Terminal (2)
[where ncurses shows]           [where gdb runs]
  +-----------------+   +-------------------------------------------+
  | $ tty           |   | $ libtool --mode=execute gdb genkeystroke |
  | /dev/ttyp0      |   | (gdb) tty /dev/ttyp0                      |
  | $ sleep 100000  |   | (gdb) b main                              |
  |  (genkeystroke) |   | (gdb) r test.txt                          |
  +-----------------+   +-------------------------------------------+
  Run "tty" inside X Terminal (1) to obtain the pseudo-tty device.  It shows
  "/dev/ttyp0" in the above example, and then we let shell sleep in order to
  accept the I/O redirection from gdb session.

  Inside gdb debugging session, it is the window, X Terminal (2), launching
  the test suite program, genkeystroke, as usual.  Then, pass the command
  "tty /dev/ttyp0", obtained from X Terminal (1).  Set the breakpoints and 
  run program after that.  Of course, you shall make key strokes inside X
  Terminal (1) instead of X Terminal (2) if you would like to input on test
  suite.

  Alternately, the automated script "debug-chewing-shell.sh" covers the above
  actions.  Change the variable $PREFERABLE_XTERM to other X terminals like
  xterm as you wish.
