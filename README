libchewing - The intelligent phonetic input method library
http://chewing.csie.net/

[-] History

libchewing is derived from Chewing input method, a xcin module
focusing on intelligent phonetic processing by lckung and 
kpchen. However, the original authors of Chewing dropped its
development, and Chewing is highly bonded with xcin, which
prevents from wider applications.


[-] Motion

Jim Huang started to separate core algorithm and logic layer
of Chewing since 2002, and he integrated his efforts into a
Chinese terminal named JMCCE as a part of its input method
modules. Also, he attempts to let more applications adapt
his efforts, so that he created New Chewing Project as the
infrastructure with writing some bridges among JMCCE, XCIN,
IIIMF, SCIM, MS-IME, etc.
