//! C compatible APIs for libchewing.
//!
//! All items are available via the C header file `<chewing.h>`.
//!
//! Function symbols are exposed from the libchewing shared library.
//!
//! Functions are organized into several modules according to the services
//! provided by them.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! As far as we expect, input method (in fact, the way for text input and
//! output, especially in multi-lingual environments) implementations are
//! becoming more and more complex in system integrations.  The emerging
//! standard for practical and flexible development cycles is required, so that
//! we are facing the impacts from various Chinese input method implementations
//! and the integration into existing framework or system designs.  At the
//! result, Chewing Input Method (abbreviated as "Chewing") attempts to be one
//! of the approaches to solve and ease the problems with the inclusion of base
//! classes, on the basis of cross-platform, and cross-operating-environment
//! derivative classes, which are built as the abstract backbone of intelligent
//! Chinese phonetic input method implementations.  From the perspectives,
//! Chewing defines the abstract behavior how an intelligent phonetic IM should
//! works via the common interface, and Chewing permits the extra parameters and
//! properties for the input method implementations to extend their specific
//! functionality.

/// Initializes chewing context and environment settings.
///
/// Most of the Chewing IM APIs require a
/// [ChewingContext][setup::ChewingContext]. To create a ChewingContext you must
/// use the [chewing_new][setup::chewing_new] function.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// Create a chewing context and deletes it after use.
///
/// ```c
/// #include <chewing.h>
/// int main(int argc, char *argv[])
/// {
///     ChewingContext *ctx = chewing_new();
///
///     /* do something */
///
///     chewing_delete( ctx );
///
///     return 0;
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Environment variables
///
/// * `CHEWING_PATH`
///     * The CHEWING_PATH environment variable is used to set the search path
///       of static data used by the Chewing IM. The format of CHEWING_PATH is
///       the same as PATH, which is multiple paths separated by ‘:’ on POSIX
///       and Unix-like platforms, or separated by ‘;’ on Windows platform. The
///       directories in CHEWING_PATH could be read-only.
/// * `CHEWING_USER_PATH`
///     * The CHEWING_USER_PATH environment variable is used to specifies the
///       path where user-defined hash data stores. This path should be writable
///       by the user, or the Chewing IM will lose the ability to remember the
///       learned phrases.
