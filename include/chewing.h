 * <center>API Collection of Chewing intelligent Chinese
 *         phonetic IM (Input Method).</center>
 *
 * <h1>Overview</h1>
 *
 * As far as we expect, input method (in fact, the way for text input and
 * output, especially in multi-lingual environments) implementations are
 * becoming more and more complex in system integrations.  The emerging
 * standard for practical and flexible development cycles is required, so that
 * we are facing the impacts from various Chinese input method implementations
 * and the integration into existing framework or system designs.  At the
 * result, Chewing Input Method (abbreviated as "Chewing") attempts to be one
 * of the approaches to solve and ease the problems with the inclusion of base
 * classes, on the basis of cross-platform, and cross-operating-environment
 * derivative classes, which are built as the abstract backbone of intelligent
 * Chinese phonetic input method implementations.  From the perspectives,
 * Chewing defines the abstract behavior how an intelligent phonetic IM should
 * works via the common interface, and Chewing permits the extra parameters
 * and properties for the input method implementations to extend their
 * specific functionality.
