**BREAKING CHANGE**

New dictionary format is not compatible with old tools. Existing user dictionary
will be automatically backed up and migrated however old tools might not be able to
manipulate the dictionary directly.

The `chewing-editor` program can still be used to edit user dictionaries. In
this release we also introduced a new `chewing-cli` tool to inspect/dump/build
user dictionaries. See `chewing-cli(1)` for more details.

This version also closed/fixed many issues. Find the complete list of closed
issues here: https://github.com/chewing/libchewing/milestone/7?closed=1

* Added
  - A new command line tool `chewing-cli` is included in this release. It can
    create or inspect dictionary files.
  - Reintroduce DictionaryMut as a separate trait.

* Changed
  - CMake default preset switched to build with rust.
  - CMake minimum required version bumped to 3.24.0.
  - System dictionary and user dictionary file now uses platform standard paths.
    See https://docs.rs/chewing/latest/chewing/path/fn.data_dir.html for
    details.
  - Improved TrieBufDictionary::from ergonomics.
  - Rename DictEntries to Entries.
  - Ensure all fallible API returns Error.
  - Improved algorithm so using Tab key to find alternative phrasing is more
    responsive.
  - Easy symbol input now accepts arbitrary long "symbols". (rust)
  - Removed duplicated symbols "●" and "○" from symbols input.

* Bug fixed
  - chewing_cand_CheckDone result was reversed in capi. (introduced in v0.7.0)
  - Correctly ignore instead of absorb keys when the pre-edit buffer is empty.
    (introduced in v0.6.0)
  - Reset pagination page number when searching for next candidate range.
    (introduced in v0.7.0)
  - chewing_bopomofo_String_static did not return key sequence for pinyin input
    mode. (introduced in v0.6.0)
  - Different chewing_*_static() functions were using one shared global buffer.
    (introduced in v0.6.0)
  - Special symbol selection missed a couple symbols that was in C version.
    (introduced in v0.7.0)
  - Panics when a new selection replaces more than one existing selections.
    (introduced in v0.7.0)
  - Selection created from alternative bopomofo was not considered in
    conversion. (introduced in v0.6.0)

* Removed
  - HashMap implemented Dictionary was removed.

* Documentation
  - Clarify the accepted value of `chewing_handle_Default` method.


What's New in libchewing 0.7.0 (Apr 7, 2024)
---------------------------------------------------------

This is the first beta release of the Rust rewrite. The library has been tested
with the AFL++ fuzzer, and most of the obvious bugs have been fixed, so it should
not crash for normal use. Now we invite power users to daily drive the beta
release in order to find more subtle bugs.

The Rust rewrite is ABI compatiable with previous releases. The most notable
difference with the C version includes a new portable dictionary format that can
be used both as system dictionary and user dictionary. Users with existing user
phrase dictionary will be automatically migrated. Old files will be backed up
automatically. With these changes, we will be able to support dictionary sharing
and loading multiple dictionaries in future releases.

* Future roadmap
  - 0.8.x after bug bashing this version will be the first public release with
    rust implementation as the default.
  - 0.9.x will focus on the stablization of the Rust Crate API.
  - 1.0.0 will be the first public release of the Rust API. C implementation
    will be removed from the repository.

* Added
  - Added Colemak-DH ANSI/Orth layout support
  - Replace bespoke RIFF+TLV file format with standard DER format. (rust)
  - Supporting migrating user dictionary file to new format. (rust)
  - Allow creating in memory user dictionary. (rust)
  - New `chewing-cli` tool can be used to create or inspect dictionary files. (rust)
  - New `chewing-cli` tool can dump or import dictionaries from CSV files. (rust)
  - Audit dependencies using cargo-vet. (rust)

* Changed
  - Buffer user dictionary changes and flush in background without blocking main
    thread. (rust)

* Bug fixed
  - Some unsigned underflow issue found by AFL++. (rust)
  - Skip symbol selection if preedit buffer is empty. (rust)
  - Allow numlock in selection mode. (rust)
  - Avoid infinite recursion. (rust)
  - Ensure to return KeyBehavior::Commit when we push to commit buffer. (rust)
  - Adjust selection offset after delete symbols. (rust)
  - Disable trace logging if no logger is enabled. (rust)
  - Should not start selection in English mode. (rust)
  - Use offset to select from paginated phrase list. (rust)

* Documentation
  - Added document for fuzzers. (rust)
  - Describe how to compile dictionary files.
  - Update build instruction and Rust MSRV info.

* Testing
  - Added a fuzzer harness with AFL++. (rust)
